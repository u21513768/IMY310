1. Pre-test Planning (250 words)
User Base Selection

To ensure the usability test effectively reflected real-world use, 
we selected participants from our intended user population. Our target 
users are movie enthusiasts who frequently track and share their viewing 
habits. We recruited five to eight participants aged 18-40, with a mix of 
genders and tech-savviness, ensuring diversity. These users were chosen for 
their familiarity with movie/series tracking apps and their active engagement 
in watching and reviewing movies.

Task Selection

We devised specific tasks that represent core functionalities of the movie/series 
tracker app, aiming to cover a range of typical user actions. Tasks included creating 
an account, adding a movie to the watchlist, searching for a specific movie, updating 
watchlist statuses, reading and interacting with user reviews, and managing account settings. 
These tasks were chosen to reflect both essential and advanced features of the app, 
ensuring a comprehensive assessment of usability across different scenarios.

Interaction Plan

To foster an effective testing environment, we planned a structured yet flexible 
interaction approach. We started with a friendly but professional introduction, 
explaining the study's purpose, the product, and what participants could expect. 
During the test, we employed the think-aloud technique, encouraging participants to 
verbalize their thoughts, while strictly avoiding any guidance on how to use the app. 
We monitored participants closely, taking detailed notes and recording the sessions 
to capture their interactions and behaviors. A satisfaction questionnaire followed 
each session to gather additional insights into user experiences and perceptions.

This meticulous preparation aimed to create a realistic testing environment that 
would yield valuable data on the app's usability, helping us identify strengths and areas for improvement.
