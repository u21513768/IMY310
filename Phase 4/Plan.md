#### 5. Monitoring Plan

- **User Handling:** Ensure participants understand their tasks without assisting them directly with the app’s functionality. Provide a supportive and accommodating environment.
- **Error Handling:** Allow participants to experience difficulties and observe how they resolve issues independently. Avoid intervening unless they ask for task clarifications.
- **Observations:** Record body language, facial expressions, and any verbal comments or questions. Track task completion times and success rates for each task.
- **Note Taking:** Use a notebook or digital document to note observations, including specific difficulties participants encounter and their strategies for overcoming them.
- **Screen Recording:** Record the screen using a tool like Zoom, ensuring participants are aware and have consented to the recording.
- **Think Aloud Technique:** Encourage participants to verbalize their thoughts as they navigate the app. Note any specific comments about usability issues or positive feedback.
