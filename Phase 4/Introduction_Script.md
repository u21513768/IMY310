Hello, and welcome to our usability test session. Thank you for taking the time to participate. My name is [Your Name], and I am part of the team developing a movie/series tracker application. Our goal today is to observe how you interact with our wireframe prototype and gather feedback on its usability.

During this session, you will be given a few scenarios to perform using the app. Please try to complete the tasks as naturally as you would in real life. We encourage you to think aloud and share your thoughts, questions, and any issues you encounter while using the app. Remember, you are not being tested; we are testing the design of our app.

We will be recording this session to review your interactions later, but your responses will remain confidential. You can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable.

Do you have any questions before we begin? If not, letâ€™s get started.
